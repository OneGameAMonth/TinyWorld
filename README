The Earth is not big enough for everyone. Population growth combined with resource decline will drain what we have very shortly, we must expand! You must send as many refuges away from Earth as you can, before the planet is dead and humankind with it. Oh, and you have, like, 3 minutes. 


How to play: 
As soon as you pop into the game, Earth is quickly becoming a wasteland. 

A/D/Left/Right: Move left/right along the solar system. 
Space: Launch a rocketship with colonists from Earth 
S: Launch a seed ship with resources from Earth 
(debug) P: Restart game, so you don't have to close/reopen 

The Point: 
Save as many people from Earth as possible, the game ends when Earth dies. Your score is the number (in Millions) of people who are not on Earth at that time. People in ships don't count (to prevent cheating by launching to nowhere at the last moment). Have it planned. The game is meant to be played in about 2-3 minute attempts. 


Sadly, I did not finish what I set out to do. I did not have the time on Sunday I had planned, so now I am releasing what I have. It is "gameplay complete", it plays, and there is a start and finish. 

What isn't included: 
Sound 
Music 
High score keeping 
Help instructions 
Aesthetics (proper graphics, backgrounds) 
Better UI 


I (luckily) had prototyped out my game on Saturday, so the gameplay is actually there. 

What is included: 
Windows executable and source code, of course. The source is a Unity project, it will generate an OSX app without issue, though I haven't included one here. 


Tips: 
Ships take time to reach their destinations, and also cost resources. With Earths resources already dwindling, you must balance out population growth on multiple planets to save as many people as possible. 

If a planet hits 0 resources, all colonists die. Do not allow this!
