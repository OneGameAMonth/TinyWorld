# Earth Is Dying!

The Earth is not big enough for everyone. Population growth combined with resource decline will drain what we have very shortly, we must expand! You must send as many refuges away from Earth as you can, before the planet is dead and humankind with it. Oh, and you have, like, 3 minutes.

You may play the game [here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/56192083/TinyWorld/EarthIsDying.html).

## How To Play
As soon as you pop into the game, Earth is quickly becoming a wasteland. 

**A/D/Left/Right:** Move left/right along the solar system.  
**Space:** Launch a rocketship with colonists from Earth  
**S:** Launch a seed ship with resources from Earth  
**(debug) P:** Restart game, so you don't have to close/reopen

## The Point
Save as many people from Earth as possible, the game ends when Earth dies. Your score is the number (in Millions) of people who are not on Earth at that time. People in ships don't count (to prevent cheating by launching to nowhere at the last moment). Have it planned. The game is meant to be played in about 2-3 minute attempts. 

## What Isn't Included
* High score keeping
* Help instructions 
* Aesthetics (proper graphics, backgrounds)
* Better UI

## Tips
* Ships take time to reach their destinations, and also cost resources
* With Earths resources already dwindling, you must balance out population growth on multiple planets to save as many people as possible
* If a planet hits 0 resources, all colonists die. Do not allow this!
* Earth cannot be saved, just try and get as many colonists out as possible
